# House Price Prediction

Welcome to the House Price Prediction project! This project predicts house prices using a Random Forest model implemented in Python. The model is built with the help of various libraries and tools including Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, and more. The project is developed using PyCharm and includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for a web-based user interface.

## Project Overview

This project leverages a Random Forest model to predict house prices based on features provided in a dataset. The dataset used in this implementation is sourced from Kaggle, but it can be replaced with any other dataset that follows a similar format. The model achieves an R-squared score of approximately 0.73.

## Features

- **Random Forest Regression Model**: Utilizes a Random Forest algorithm to predict house prices.
- **Web Interface**: Includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for user interaction.
- **Flexible Dataset**: Allows for changing datasets while maintaining similar performance.
